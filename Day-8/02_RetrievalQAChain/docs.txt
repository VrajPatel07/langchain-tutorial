ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. 
It simplifies the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.

- It is developed and maintained by Facebook.
- The latest version of React is React 19.
- Uses a virtual DOM for faster updates.
- Supports a declarative approach to designing UI components.
- Ensures better application control with one-way data binding.

How does React work?
    - React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. 
    - It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM.
